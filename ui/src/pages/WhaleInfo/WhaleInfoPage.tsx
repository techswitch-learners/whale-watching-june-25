                            <li> Scan from left to right, slowly, and then back again. Look close to shore, and look out across the horizon. Watch for anything that breaks the surface of the water.</li>
                            <li> Look for boats, especially if they are stopped. Sometimes the best way to find marine mammals is to find the other people who are watching them. </li>
                            <li> Don't get fooled by driftwood or logs that look like animals, floating on the surface of the water. </li>
